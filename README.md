Hybrid Source Apportionment
-----------------------------

This is a package implementing a novel method for source apportionment of PM2.5. And an attempt at, um, [actual science](http://simplystatistics.org/2013/01/23/statisticians-and-computer-scientists-if-there-is-no-code-there-is-no-paper/).

Documentation is still (clearly) ongoing. Stay tuned!
